## Tim Feriss' DiSSS
Tim Ferriss is a pop culture meta-learner, and present his own manifesto for
"Learning how to learn" in his book, _The 4-Hour Chef_(4HC). Whether he is yet
another salesman of the Good Life or the epitomy of Generation X meta-learning
life hackery I leave to the reader.

The 4HC proposes learning is best accomplished by the identification and
application of high-reward material and studying strategies. The "DiSSS" system
helps readers in reducing an opaque subject into primitives, prioritizing the
value of each component in regards to the reader's goal of understanding the
subject, and arranging the study in order of prerequisites (the final S has to
do with motivation). He also provides the CFE acronym for developing study
programs and aids, emphasizing summarization techniques, providing guidelines
for setting a study routine, and tricks for boosting learning by association.

### Key Words
"Deconstruct" has particular significance to Ferriss, which I interpret to mean
"objective reduction".  Reduction simply meaning "making smaller things out of
bigger things"; in this case, it's the discovery of sub-concepts or techniques
within larger subjects, such as shooting a basketball, or braising a roast.
"Objective" is used here to mean "universal", as opposed to the local nature of
subjectivity. A reduction is objective if it applies universally, and any
thinking person could logically agree on a similar decomposition; note that this
doesn't exclude _different_ decompositions, as long as they are done rationally.

7. Encoding


#### Deconstruction
Deconstruction seeks to teach you how to reduce the topic into learnable chunks.
He provides four methods for doing so: Reducing, Interviewing, Reversal, and
Translating. Reducing is confusing, as that's essentially an synonym for
deconstructing, but I believe he uses it here more to mean "What are the
essential parts?" His example being Japanese characters, of which there are
thousands, which reduce into distinct spatial regions called _radicals_, of
which there are 214. We have now found the primitives that make up all
higher-level structures.

> What are the essential parts?

Interviewing has the same goal, but leverages other people to do the work
for you. The downside is that they may have so heavily internalized their elite
knowledge that they no longer understand how to look at it from a bottom-up
perspective; hence, you ask questions to help them dissect their performance.
The idea of Inversion shows up here in the form of questions of "What should I
_not_ do?" There is some work to do on establishing credibility, as if the
interviewee's methods haven't been proven reliable, there's a large risk in
setting up a false expert.

> Who/What else is good? Are *you* good? What shouldn't I do? What should I do?
> In what order should I do that?

Quite frankly, I find his section on "Reversal" to be near-useless in terms of
teaching the concept. See my notes on Inversion under [Final
Thoughts](#final-thoughts).

The bit on Translation boils down to "leverage association by relating it to
things you already know", in his case, your existing learned languages, and
memorize just enough that you can begin to apply. The first principle deserves
more care than I'm going to give it here. The second is more interesting, as it
drives at answering the question "When should I put the book down and start
doing?", with the response, "As soon as you've learnt enough to do something." I
interpret his anecdote/assignment about learning how to taste as a story on
bottom-up learning.

> How much of this do I have to learn before I can do something with it?

#### Selection

What physical practice teaches you the most conceptually for the time
investment? Once you've identified the fundamentals, you need to look at the
surface area covered by fundamental within the master topic itself. It is
essentially the deconstructed fundamentals by descending ROI, and taking from
the start of the list. I'm highly reminded of the model __Efficiency vs
Effectiveness__.

> Are you studying __effectively__ before you maximize __efficiency__?

#### Sequencing

Much of "Sequencing" reads as an additional example to "Deconstruction";
deducing the key parts of the skill. Besides emphasizing the importance of
learning high-level concepts, a couple interesting points arise from reading
between the lines. Ferris' anecdote about learning the female "follow" before
the male "lead" serves as a moral of how the better you understand the problem,
the stronger and swifter your understanding of the solution will come to you.
He also alludes to a phenomena of finding a physical practice that teaches a
broad swath of concepts. For him, focusing on footwork brought along lessons on
the principles of posture, foot position, and weight shifting. While this could
simply be taught in terms of ROI, I sense a stronger tie between a physical,
practiceable action and the multitude of essential concepts it brings together.
For Ferriss, practicing footwork provided an initially simple entry into the
skill that expands endlessly, regardless of training age.

> Choose your practice wisely. Find the balance between complexity of
> intermingled concepts and immediate simplicity of practice. Find your
> "simplex" skill.


#### Stakes
I'm not covering Stakes. It has to do with maintaining motivation by threatening
yourself with monetary. The one interesting memory in me is to that of
Stoicism's negative visualization, but instead of using it to reduce stress and
worry by confronting your fears, you use it to _enhance_ motivation by
visualizing how you'll feel/be if you _don't_ carry through. Hell, maybe you
could even make a checklist for motivation: Bargain a time-limit, negatively
visualize *not* doing what you should, positively visualize doing what you
should...there's probably something else. Anyway, I'm not covering Stakes. Next!

#### Compression
Whew. Are we done? Almost. We've made it through Ferriss' DSSS, skipping one
'S'.

Having found, prioritzed, and ordered your fundamentals, Compression focuses on
finding an effective representation. Ferriss sets a limit of what can fit on
one page, and lays out two kinds of compressions: the top-down, deductive,
"presciptive" one-pager that outlines principles & rules, and the bottom-up,
inductive, "practice" one-pager that provides you examples & implementations.
This is easy to see the value in; if you can't summarize the high-level
principles that underly the topic, you probably don't understand it, and we all
know the value of seeing the right example at the right time.

If you cross-breed my ideas of "write your own book" and "recursive expansion",
you arrive at something similar. I do like Ferriss' split approach between
top-down and bottom-up information. This common theme between both types of
information shows up so often that it deserves to be recognized. I would go one
step further and recommend this 1-pager be rewritten periodically. What you
believe summarizes the topic one week into the field is very different from what
you'll believe after one year of study.

#### Frequency
Frequency starts off with some anecdote about doing a 48-hour crash course on
professional cooking side-by-side with a professional chef. It seemed more
applicable to the Deconstruction/Selection The only moral I
took away from this regarding learning was you can learn a lot from paying a
professional to be your personal tutor for a weekend. Whould've thought?

Then he opens up his more pertinent-section on long-term learning frequency with
another seemingly unrelated anecdote, this time about Y Combinator. Apparently
their start-up timeline looks eerily similar to Ferriss' timeline for
learning. How this distinction "proves" Ferriss' take on learning over time
isn't clear. Laying gripes about _non sequitur_ intro stories aside: Ferriss'
timeline has an initially steep learning curve (that's a __good__ thing, means
rapid knowledge/skill acquisition). This is followed by a drop in performance
due to operator confusion as they attempt to apply their new knowledge. Then
improvement as the confusion resides and skills solidify. The operator stays at
this solidified level for some time, roughly as long as it took from the
beginning of their education to reaching the plateau, and then an inflection
point is reached at their skills take-off towards mastery. Keep in mind, the
Y-axis of this graph is (appears?) total mastery of the skill, although
confidence is also conflated? It's not clear.

A student applies this graph as such: Choose your objective and timeline. Apply
DSSS, and budget your learning blocks to fit your time window. Now, learn. As
you progress through your milestones, the learning graph helps you to expect
setbacks, and look for when things should "start to come together".

It is difficult to judge how much I believe this works, probably because there
is single data point of Tim Ferriss saying "this is what I've noticed." With
such limited evidence, it's anecdtoal at best. Interestingly, the Y Combinator
start-up success chart, whose y-axis we must guess to be something like "How
much things don't suck", seems more believable with its lack of the post-peak
valley, instead settlingly into a nice long grind towards progress. Ferriss'
chart looks possibly correct if you're graphing the human emotional rollarcoster
ride that you want _right now_. Things often start out a lot of fun, and then
the novelty wears off and they start to feel like work. Better is to learn to
enjoy the process, taking enjoyment in the practice of it all, and watch small
continuous gains. You know what it looks like? Compound interest. And _that_
feels right.

I guess this is a long way to say I didn't learn anything about learning from
"Frequency", but it did give me a chance to muse.

#### Encoding
I'm also doing Encoding. It's focused on memorization techniques, which I don't
care about. I'm chasing understanding, not rote memorization.

### Final Thoughts
Interestingly, Ferriss's sample interviews questions from the "Deconstruct"
section re-confirms a guideline I first came across from Charles Munger through
Farnam Street Weekly: "Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance."
This is applicable to the counter-arguments against mimicing "classic" top
performers, labeling them as a group of people who succeed despite of their best
efforts, due to innate gifts and beneficial environment. They produce optimal
output from sub-optimal training.

*BEGIN BOOK CRITIQUE* A word on the misuse of "inversion": it is the practice of turning the
_problem_ inside-out, not the approach. Inverting the goal of becoming a better
swimmer transforms it into "how can I _not_ be a _bad_ swimmer"? Inverting
training methodology, as suggested by the Arthur Jones quotes on page 32, can
produce a dangerous loop. For example, inverting popular wisdom on marathon
training equates to running short distances which low frequency. But
_re_-inverting that leads you right back to high-frequency long-distance
training. However, inverting the question of into "What does a bad marathon
runner do, so I don't do those things" consistently produces the same result.
As such, inversion is useful for applying underlying principles and arriving at
clear practices, but the examples given by Ferriss of weight lifting, building a
fire, and others, do more to obscure what the model of Inversion is and how it's
applied than to provide take-home knowledge. *END BOOK CRITIQUE*.

Another point worth mentioning is Ferriss' emphasis on __margin of safety__,
which I've interpreted to be the skill's difficulty. Essentially, it is Ferriss'
justification for focusing on the Low Difficulty, High Reward quadrant of
learning.  Said quad chart would be an interesting exercise in the Discovery
phase of skill learning, and may prove practical before selecting where to
begin.

A lot of Ferriss' writing follows the pattern of Name-Drop, Personal Anecdote
of Wild Success, Now You Do It But I Won't Quite Explain Why It Actually Works
For You To Understand It Yourself. Much of the insight I've gleaned from this
review has come from carefully reading between-the-lines and noting the
hints to other's thoughts and methodologies. With his lack of depth, I can't
properly evaluate his methods, and thus I can't evaluate whether or not these
ways truly work as well as he claims. And maybe that's how he likes it to be.
Paradoxically, I understand now why I always felt incapable of putting Ferriss'
methods into practice: there's not enough here to understand them in the first
place. To give his method a fair judging, they deserve their own book.
