* Know the author(s) and organizations
* Know the intellectual context
* Use your unconscious mind
* Rehearse, and use multiple modes

## Decide how much time you'll spend
Time is our unfortunate master. Edwards simply says that if the goal is to make
it through the book, you've got to adjust your reading to work with the time you
have. This is a natural conclusion if you believe in [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law). If you don't, you've never worked at a corporation.

jdb - This is something I certainly struggle with. I still place books on a
lofty pedestal, where their words are Truth, and there is no nobler a way to
spend time than idly dragging your mind across their pages. But c'mon. We've got
things to do. And if you believe [Adler]({{< relref "learning/HtRaB.md" >}}),
only 1 out of 100 books are truly worth investing large amounts of time and
thought into. The moral: You're reading for a reason, so stick to it. Which
brings us to

## Have a purpose and a strategy
A call for knowing the reasons why you're reading the book, and a plan of attack
for taking it apart. The former can't be given to you, but the latter most
certainly can. The following questions are provided as starters:

1. Who is the author?
1. What are the book's arguments?
1. What is the evidence that supports these?
1. What are the book's conclusions?

Answering those, where's another set of guidelines to follow which I'll
summarize as "now tear the arguments apart." Literally debate, both sides, of
the arguments you find. The depth of your efforts will be determined by the
[previous section]({{< relref "decide-how-much-time-youll-spend" >}}).

## Read Actively
A call to interrogate the shit out of the book. What do _you_ think the book is
about? How do _you_ think the author knows what he's saying? I suppose you could
think of this as the tactics to your strategy.

## Know the author(s) and organizations
Knowing the author is a professor tells you there writing is likely to be
steeped in whitepaper references, built on other academic research, and they
have a vested interest in their own research. If the author's a layman doing a
synoptical reading of the field, their motives may be to establish themselves as
an authority, and not think to, have access to, or know of the same research
resources the professor had. Similarly, knowing the year it was written,
political agenda, intended audience - all provide the background influencing the
author, and thus his works. More context is always better, until it starts to
impeded your real goal of making it through the book and learning what you want
to learn.

Good sources of context: Author bio, bibliography, book cover review blurbs
(Intellectuals? Journalists? Businessman?).

## Read it three times
Once during your discovery phase, again in pursuit of deep understanding, and
finally to collect and consolidate your learnings.  Edwards' says this is the
__key technique__.

#### Overview
The first phase, Overview, emphasizes quick, shallow structural inspection. Do
your best to glean the intent of the book (What is it about?) and mark where you
see the author making their arguments. Literally mark it; see [Use PTML]({{< relref "use-ptml" }}).
Read like the author has something you need, and they're stubbornly trying to
waste your time. Take the measure of this book in no uncertain terms.

Also, this is where your first round of informed questions will come from. Take
a moment after finishing the book this first time through to pull these
questions together; they will become your new motivation and lesson plan for the
second phase, Detail.

Use 5-10% of the time you've allotted.

#### Detail
Now that you've ripped your way through it once, read the book again. The goal
in this Detail phase is understanding. Get thoughtful. Linger on unclear or
through-provoking sections. Use your guiding notes from the PML phase to get
busy, and take it from there.

Still focus on the high-content sections of the book, such as the beginnings and
endings of chapters and sections. You are now in full interrogation mode, bright
and alert for the author's arguments. What are they proposing? How are they
backing that claim up? If this proposition is true, what does this mean for what
we think or how we act?

Spend 70-80% of your time here.

jdb - This is where we get into observations that "every book should be a
pamphlet". There are only so many arguments a book can make and stay within the
same intent. A truly comprehensive book will have layers of arguments, and will
thus be read differently when you're a novice versus when you're a expert in the
field. Such good, or even great, books will thus require re-reading as you gain
experience.

#### Notes
This phase has dual-purposes. One, you're trying to internalize what you've
identified as the really important concepts. Two, you're building your
repository of notes for future reference. It's understanding tempered with the
fallibility of memory. Plus, you don't _want_ to remember everything, as you
can't know exactly what will be useful in the future. As long as you know where
to find it, you'll serve your future self well.

The goal of understanding is accomplished by having to synthesize your notes
into your own words. Presumably you've located arguments, weighed them based on
evidence, and accepted or disagreed with the conclusions. _Write these
assessments down_. Even better if you can do so with full citation. Edwards
makes the important observation that "notes will be useless unless you can
easily find them again" - true that! He recommends using a citation manager such
as Endnote, Zotero, or Bookends to digitally manage this growing corpus of
rendered insights.

Edwards believes this should take 10-20% of your time, total.

jdb - I've got a book box of college notes sitting in my closet as a testament
to the conflict between the desire to not give fought-for knowedge and the
difficult work of making that knowledge accessible down the road. On Edwards
suggestion of the citation manager, I've picked up
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). So far, so good. Still getting up to speed
with it.

#### Using time wisely
Reading for more than an hour is an uphill battle against biological limits to
human attention. However, you'll want to set aside some time at the beginning
and end of that block the cost of context switching.

### Focus on the parts with high information content
Edwards proposes that non-fiction has an hourglass info structure.

[!./HourglassInfoStructure.png]. I forget how to do image inserts in markdown.

Here's a sample progression: Book covers->Table Of Contents-> Index(High ref
items)->Bibliography(Context)->Preface/Intro/Abstract->Conclusion->Pictures->Chapter
Intros & Conclusions->Heavily formatted text.

### Use PTML
Mark up what you're reading. This is one good reason to read paper over digital,
although some solutions exist. Research has shown writing results in better
retention over typing[ref needed]. Don't do it too much; two to three marks a
page on average. Summarize when you can using single words or phrases.

> The point of this is to distill, reduce, eliminate the unnecessary.

Build your own system; he doesn't recommend anything, but I will: Underline what
you want to grab your attention when re-reading. Note arguments and their
propositions, supporting evidence, and conclusions with something like a
superscript `p`, `e`, and `c`, with subscripted numeric indexes to keep track of
what goes to what. This has the advanatage that you can use it for intra-book
references, if it's worth your time. Only reword when it a) will save you a bunch of
time during the Notes phase, or b) is confusing, and you need to mentally sort it
out.

### Use a citation manager
If you're storing notes, you better have a way of conveniently retrieving the
notes you want. Convenient is a personal definition; I know Ryan Holiday is
content with an all index card system. I am not, and have picked up [Zotero]. So
far, so good.

### Use your unconscious mind
Cramming doesn't work. You can only perform at a high-level continuously for so
long. Figure out what that is for you; if you don't know, try an hour, adjust
from there. Know that much of our processing happens unconsciously, so use time
to your advantage, and spread out your sessions. When you sit down, quiz
yourself on what you've come across so far.

jdb - Starting a reading session by ruminating on your progress and current
opinion smacks of distributed practice/testing, which is a Good Thing.

### Rehearse, and use multiple modes
A call to "use it or lose it." Several statements about how you need to use the
knowledge in multiple ways to make it stick, but no evidence to back it up. I
will file this suggestion as anecdotal. I'm not arguing he's wrong; completely
the opposite. He's [well supported] in other research; I'm just noting he
doesn't spend the words fleshing out his argument for this practice.

jdb - But do it anyway. The more I study learning, the more and more I believe
that understanding is cemented by creation. Creation here is liberally defined:
You "create" an argument during conversation, an essay, a project, a painting, a
lesson, whatever.

## Conclusion
A beautiful application of the 20/80 rule to Adler's ["How to Read a Book"]({{<
relref "learning/HtRaB.md" >}}), with some small additions for the modern age
(digital citation managers).
