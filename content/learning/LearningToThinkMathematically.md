Four points, in summary:

1. Concepts have prerequisites.
2. Every field has its own heuristics.
3. Metacognition is our mental compass.
4. Connecting the abstract to the concrete is essential.

People bring unique knowledge bases to the lecture room(/MOOC/Textbook/Pirated
Textbook). While one way of explaining a concept may *fit* with a number of
students, it may completely fail to take hold with the rest. One of the finicky
arts of teaching is the empathy to recognize the instructions While one way of
explaining a concept may *fit* with a number of students, it may completely fail
to take hold with the rest. One of the finicky arts of teaching is the empathy
to recognize the instruction's failure-to-land, determine what questions the
students has _or_ what incorrect knowledge they're working with[^just ain't so],
and then lead them to the right conclusions.

Every discipline leverages heuristics to do its work. For writing, you use
outlines, topic sentences, thesis generation, concept mapping, and structural
templates. We're all (aren't we?) taught in K-12 that a basic essay has an
introduction, supporting paragraphs, and a conclusion; this, while
unimaginative, gives an unconfident writer a place to start, avoids many
pitfalls of winging-it, and generally gets you from point a->b, however
painful the road may be for the reader. With math, you've got diagramming,
relaxing the problem constraints to be easier, solving sub-problems (your lemmas),
and solving for the extremes and hoping you took care of the middle along the
way. Point is, a discipline comes with a set of culturally-curated set of
instructions for doing work within them; have you bothered to make use of
thousands of years of condensed good ideas?

Schoenfeld says [metacognition] is the third key to effective problem-solving.
He uses an interesting comparison between the problem-solving processes
of undergraduates versus math faculty members. Given a math proof, the
undergrads jump right in to trying solutions, but had trouble verbalizing _why_
they were doing what they were doing. In contrast, the professional
mathematician the majority of his time during the analysis/planning phase,
occasionally testing out the validity of his ideas before returning to more
thought. He (Schoenfeld) states that with practice, asking yourself "why are you
doing that" can be instilled, and undergraduates can develop the same
problem-solving strategies as "advanced scholars".

I do agree that metacognition is key to effective thinking, and thus problem
solving. I'm going to make an argument though: this example is not a lack of
metacognition. This is a lack of just cognition. The problem the students were
having was that they _didn't_ think (enough) before started applying patterns.
If metacognition is "reasoning about your reasoning" and you don't have
reasoning in the first place, then it's a non-starter. First-order thinking gets
you to a local maxima; second-order is what frees you up to try again.

Finally, a students beliefs about the topic can help or hurt, but not in  the
same vein as Dweck's Growth Mindest. Rather, this is as to the utility of the
knowledge. You know, the 10th grader setting in algebra 2 asking "Ms. Trisdale,
when am I _ever_ going to need to know how to do this?" Schoenfeld says this
kind of thinking short-circuits the effectiveness of whatever they _do_
takeaway. His example about division applied unrealistically is curious, as it
seems to relate more to his (meta)cognition argument than a belief structure.
I think he's saying students who have false beliefs about the field fail to
develop their ability to use their knowledge correctly; their understanding
is discordant with reality, and thus it isn't effective.

[metacognition]: Metacognition - It just sounds so smart. "You cognizing right
    now? Nah man, way better - _meta_-cognizing. Oh shit, sorry to bother you."
