## Berkely: The [How Students Learn] Project
[How Students Learn]: http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~kihlstrm/GSI_2011.htm

For practice, let's apply SQ3R.

### Survey
Defines learning, different types of learning. Focuses on teacher-led
instruction, as you'd expect from work by Berkeley, a teaching institution.
Significant sections on improving understanding and retention.

### Questions
* What kinds of memory are there?
* How are elaboration and organization different?
* How does memory work?
* How should people be taught?
* What is mastery learning, and is it different from regular learning?
* What are the most effective techniques for understanding? For remembering?
* How much more effective is learning when you incorporate testing?
* Is it more effective to lead a horse to water or help the horse find the water
  on its own, when it comes to understanding & remembering?
* Is their a universally "best" way to learn?
* Why is it we _want_ to learn?

### Review
> we learn best when we learn progressively, building new knowledge on old
> knowledge

* Encoding
    * Elaboration - association with existing knowledge
    * Organization - grouping knowledge together
* Knowledge
    * Procedural
        * Motor
        * Mental
        * Famous by the 10k hour rule
    * Declarative
        * Episodic - events in time
        * Semantic - abstract knowledge

* Grouping items aids in learning (organization). It also decreases interference
  in recall later.

* Multiple-choice tests help in cueing recall, thus easing pain initially. This
  is a huge problem for MOOCs.
* Multiple encodings per memory enhance its ability for recall later; more edges
  to the same node.

> Learning proceeds best when the student already has some background, on which
> he or she can build, and which can provide a framework for generating
> expectations and questions.

* Pre-testing helps set the stage. This is a Catch-22 when you're self-learning,
  unless there was an external repository of questions...I imagine the prompts
  would need to be fairly rich in contextual information. Otherwise, "thin"
  questions coupled with lack of background schema would be difficult to relate
  to.

**Left off at PQ4R**, which is a system that dates back to 1972! Why are these
methodologies not taught more broadly? Why must I seek them out?

We primarily think of learning by experience. Observational learning is when we
leverage other people's experiences to learn from them. We learn by example much
as a child does when it observes its parents, and we learn by precept when we
are taught from experience by proveyors of this knowledge.

> There is no more efficient way for students to learn, I think, than from a
> well-organized course of lectures accompanied by a well-written textbook

Mastery learning progresses a student when sufficient skill is demonstrated,
instead of a timeline. The proctor (teacher) determines course
structure, dividing course content into related modules or chunks, and sets the
progression. The teacher then becomes a passive resource, answering questions
and pointing out mistakes. The student progresses once they've tested highly
enough on a module. See the paper "Good-Bye, Teacher", 1968.

Distributed testing and practice testing stands as the two most productive
learning techniques. What's impressive is the generality of the positive impact
testing has. Testing immediately after study helps, and so does testing a week
after. Testing improves performance even without feedback as to what you got
wrong. Testing improves memory over re-reading. Testing beats
mind(concept)-mappping the material. Interestingly, the effect may be subtle,
too subtle for conscious awareness - the "test" group under-reported the benefit
they'd received from testing compared to the cramming and concept-mapping group.
A moral for self-doubt and objective measures.


> We learn by being tested, or by testing ourselves.

> Testing improves retention, even more than extra study, and this is true even
> when subjects don't get any feedback from the test

Spaced repetition is far more effective than cramming; heard that enough. The
authors estimate that the optimal spacing is "5-10% of the study-test delay"(?).
Interleaved problem types makes _practice_ feel more difficult, but improves
test performance (so hopefully real understanding as well). So mix it up
(interleave). But not too much (Skinner's PSI course modules). The author has a
short rebuttal to complaints against "teaching to test", where he argues that if
the test is good, that's exactly what we want! Curriculums _should_ change to
teach the test; "what gets measured, gets improved".

**So what makes a good test?**. The questions should be obviously related to the
material (Face validity). They should be  a representative sampling of the
knowledge body (Content validity). They should correlate with some form of
external performance (empirical validity). And question performance within a
test should correlate to each other (Internal Consistency).

Repeatedly, the notion that "testing is hard" appears and re-appears (and
re-appears, and re-appears). But, I begin to wonder if one's
mastery/understanding is _best_ demonstrated by the ability to generate tests?
It almost seems paradoxical, but I expect its more a progression: A better mind
generates better questions. You learn best by testing, at first taking tests,
and then writing them. It forces you to re-re-re-think the essence of the topic,
trying to tease from it ever-more accurate abstractions and concepts.

Cumulative final exams are probably the best test you can take, due to forcing
students to re-study the entire body of knowledge under one context.

When creating a test, or even a question, make clear the following: What exactly
is it you want the student to do? What is the pedagogical purpose behind the
task? How will you evaluate the quality of the work?

When comparing self-directed discovery learning to direct instruction by a
teacher, the only middle-ground you arrive at is one which is shared
appropriately _between_ the two strategies. Discovery learning promotes skills
of inquisition, peer-learning, lengthens retention, and encourages following
threads that lead in surprising but rewarding directions. However, diret
instruction maximizes efficiency of instruction, provides feedback in the form
of tests and on-the-spot corrections, and provides curated progressions into the
topic. Ultimately, the researchers behind the paper these facts were taken from
recommend alternating, beginning with discovery then following up with
instruction.

This, to me, strongly parallels the findings that pre-testing, and pre-study
question generation (the Q in SQ3R) enhance your study. It also shows up
constantly in HtRaB, having a conversation with the author by interrogating
right through the words on the page. It is an unnatural feeling to stop and ask
questions about something you presumably know little about. This is something I
am eager to learn more about.

- Lee and Anderson (Annual Review of Psychology, 2013)

Meta-cognition about memory goes by the name **metamemory**, and we are bad at
it. Beliefs like cramming and highlighting are effective ways to learn are
proven to be far less useful than things we detest, like steady, deliberate
practice over time and testing ourselves before, during, and after (aargh!).
Metamemory does have a number of interesting aspects for investigating itself:
Encoding, which breaks down into ease-of-learning judgments (how hard will this
be?) and judgments of learning (how well is this going?); Storage, evaluated by
feeling-of-knowing judgements (have you mastered it?); and retrieval, made of
source-monitoring judgments (where did you learn this?) and confidence in
retrieved answers (are you correct?).

- "Factors affecting the self-regulation of learning", Bjork et al. (2013)

I greatly enjoyed learning that there is practically _no_ empirical evidence
backing the notion of different learning styles. The left-brain-right-brain
hyptohesis, the visual/verbal/kinesthetic hypothesis, the Myers-Briggs Type
indicators - all have yet to be supported by science as to whether someone
learns more effectively based off their approach. Only the simplest hypothesis
by David Kolb, his **cycle of learning**, seemed to offer any guidance, and that
argues we all share the _same_ pattern of learning, not individual responses.
For reference sake, here it is: Immediate Concrete Experience, Observation and
Reflection, Theory and Deductive Inferences. We experience something,
we think about it, we make generalizations _ad infinitum_. This is practically
philosophy; actually, this _is_ philosophy: epsitomology. If you see the devil,
tell him Descartes says "Hi"...I will love reading that again, one day.

Kihlstrom finishes the discussion of the "learning styles" school of thought
on a salient note: Even _if_ there was a measurable benefit to tailoring
education plans to individual learning styles, would the cost of rolling out
such a plan _en masse_ overwhelm whatever benefits students would reap?

### Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Factors
We move onto non-cognitive factors of learning; that is, what  happens _around_
teaching/learning.

- P.H. Winne and J.c. Nesbit in "The Psychology of Academic Achievement" (Annual Review of Psychology, 2010)

Students prefer firm deadlines for getting work done; if a final paper is due,
require an outline and draft before to faciliate progress. It is a way of
imposing "best practices" on the work as well. And externally imposed deadlines
are more effective than self-imposed ones; I agree most whole-heartedly. Many a
best-intentioned objective towards my most fervent dreams has gone by, leaving
me enraged at my own apparent lack of self-control. But I am not alone (and
neither are you). Negotiating with oneself in the form of rewards for good
behavior can be effective. Kihlstrom does not say explicitly, but I believe this
is also taken from the Ariely and Wertenbroch (2002) paper.

### Sleep
Not much new information. One fact about slow-wave (Stage NREM) sleep being
especially important regarding memory consolidation.

## Implicit Theories of Learning
Originally, post-behaviorist theories on learning supposed that reward drove
learning. Then we saw that animals learned because they were alive; a monkey
will solve a puzzle because it likes solving puzzles, regardless of the reward
on the other side.

> monkeys love Fruit loops

Why do we want to learn so badly? Epistemic curiousity argues its inborn; Need
for Closure states we hate being fuzzy on the details. Which leads into Dweck's
"Growth Mindest". In short: we constantly develop beliefs about the world
through experience. These beliefs kind-of look like scientific theories, except
light on the science; psychologists call them "implicit theories". One such
common theory we all seem to have, according to Dweck, regards our own
competence. Entity theorists view intelligence as a fixed entity; you got it or
you don't. Incrementalists, our growth mindsetters, view intelligence as a
living, malleable thing; feed it, and it shall grow. Fascinatingly, if you're an
entity theorist, you're primarily motivated to look smart over gaining
knowledge. In the long term, this will make you an obnoxious prick to be around
(my words, not his/hers). Being told "you're smart" can undermine efforts
towards _becoming_ smart(er), and increase avoidance of mistakes (which would
threaten their world-view of being smart!) and increase reliance on that innate
brilliance everyone keeps talking about. Imagine being told you're very strong
while growing up (there's got to be a Twilight Zone about this). And maybe you
_are_ somewhat strong, courtesy of your environment, parents, genetics, and the
hobbies you fell into. But you fail at truly impressive feats of strength, and
those failures _threaten your entire concept of who you are and what you're
capable of_. This, obviously being a bad feeling, negatively reinforces you to
_not_ try again, especially if people are still telling you you're strong. This
goes off into how much of our personal concept of ourselves is formed by
people's reactions to us, and how much that is a good/bad thing. Back to work.

### Intrinsic Motivation

> Monkeys will work for grapes, but they'll also work for poker chips with which
> they can purchase grapes.

This section _really_ talks about the effect of reward upon intrinsic
motivation. Fascinatingly, it shows how incentives can perversely
_de_-incentivize the behavior you're trying to increase, at least over the long
run. Rewarding children for coloring, an act of play, leads to reductions in how
much they do it! Giving money in exchange for performance creates performance
proportional to what you pay someone - no more, no less. But, and this is an
important 'but', only if the reward is _expected_. Surprising someone with a
reward _does_ reinforce behavior. As to why, it's believed that the expected
reward comes off as controlling, that someone is trying to blatantly get you
to do something.  On the other hand, an informational reward, i.e. feedback as
to how you did, tends to maintain or increase motivation. So feedback, delivered
neutrally, is motivating, as is the occasional postive second-order effect (a
reward).

These points remind me of research on the Flow state. Some of the key pillars of
Flow are having the right amount of challenge and fast feedback. If you're doing
well, seeing your performance go up is reinforcing; if you're doing worse, the
desire to improve is motivating. You can't lose! Unless, apparently, someone
starts paying you to do it. This speaks to the oft-heard anecdote that once
your hobby becomes your job, it's no longer as fun as it used to be.

Harackiewicz also, thankfully, tackled what we all feel but I've been dying to
see empiricized (word?): how much does knowing _why_ you're learning something
affect how _well_ you learn it? Said another way, does the relevancy of
information affect your ability to learn? Yes, yes it does. But first, an
important fact to internalize - you lose interest over time.  Even the things
you really, really like. I already knew this, you already knew this, but maybe
the science can make this hit home. There _is_ good news, and its pretty damn
good - you can stop the decline. Students who tested well on the midterm saw
their interest level out at the pretty-high mark (4.5 out of 6). Even better, students who
wrote on _why_ what they were learning was relevant to their lives, e.g. why
they should care about what they're learning, _also maintained the same level of
interest_ (4.5/6)!. By contrast, students who didn't do so hot on the midterm
and didn't reflect on the benefits of the course continued to lose interest for
the rest of the semester. This was a one-time essay, only a couple paragraphs,
halfway through a semester (so six or eight weeks in).

The takeaway is __feeling what you're learning is relevant matters__, no matter
how obvious it may seem. Many Achieve Your Dreams programs have you do some kind
of goal-setting at the start of your endeavours. From this research, more
important are the reasons behind why you're setting the goal in the first place.
Personally, concrete goals demotivate me. I'll probably overestimate what I can
do, then feel bad when I can't hit it. If you can't _directly_ influence the
metric, it will just drive you crazy. Track it, by all means, and track the
second/third/deca-order behaviors that you think will lead to changing that
primary metric; a little bit of statistics will give you correlation measures,
if you're having a hard time figuring out what's working. But if you stop
caring at all, there's little hope of getting what you want.

## What Are We Trying to Teach?
Here Kihlstrom speaks, almost as an aside, setting Empiricism down and picking
up the hat of Intuited Wisdom, on the underlying moral principles (he borrows
the term "intellectual virtues") of learning. The list includes Love of Truth,
Perseverance, Humility, Empathy. It resonates. Anyone who truly sets down this
path of self-learning _must_ learn how to decide what is true for themselves,
understand how truth is relative, know their current limits (how else would you
know not just what to learn, but whether or not you _have_ learned?), how to
persist in the face of daunting progressions, the ability to hold objectively
(to the best of our ability) multiple arguments at once, and so, so much more.
You __can not__ teach these directly, but I believe you inspire a __want__ for
these virtues. Of course, inspiration requires a belief it can be done, and what
better a way than to make yourself the living example others need to believe in?

## What is to be Done?
Kihlstrom kindly summarizes himself:

1. Distribute study. Each concept needs to be hit at least twice, separated
   by weeks.
1. Use examples _and_ problems; shifting weight from the former to the latter.
1. Illustrate where you can.
1. Back the abstract with the concrete. Your top-down must connect to your
   bottom-up.
1. Testing promotes learning. I'll strengthen this statement: _questioning_ is
   effective learning.
1. Time management matters. Mastery is difficult to measure in the moment.
   Topics need to be revisited, a progression through the material needs to be
   presented, testing and projects need to be carefully interspersed if  we're
   to maximize the return on our expended time.
1. Ask deep questions. Rote memorization, I've come to view, is a means to the
   end. We memorize for the purpose of _doing_ something with it. Even
   professional memorizers who specialize in speed-memorizing the order of decks
   of cards or the digits of pi do so because they view themselves as pushing
   the limits of human memory, not because that particular card order was
   meaningful to them.
1. Know why you're learning what you're learning. Learning for the sake of
   learning is fine to start with. It's fun. Monkeys may love Fruit Loops, but
   they also just like solving puzzles. But I bet a monkey put in a cage to
   solve a new puzzle, day after day _ad nauseum_, would start to lose interest,
   if not develop outright depression. You do things for a reason, however it
   may change. Keep the dream alive; learn consciously.
