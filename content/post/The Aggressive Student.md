Learning is being in a race against yourself. These things help.

## The Rapid Acquisistion of Highly-Technical Information
Learning very technical information is unique from the general problem of
learning in a few ways. First of all, the end-result is entirely mental. Either
you understand the concepts well enough to accomplish your task, or you do not.
This is in contrast to learning a song on the piano, where a subconscious system
is learning instead, like training motor patterns for rote memorization.

Imagine your current state of skill or knowledge as a wavefront. Inside its
boundary is your "known", and outside is the "unknown".
Your awareness of an Unknown item is determined by its distance from the
boundary of this wavefront.

A few corollaries:
1) You can only learn what lies against this wavefront.
2) You can "reach" into the Unknown by attempting (and failing) to
This "reaching" is defined by your failure to completely learn; otherwise,
you'd be at step one. However, this primes you to learn the material.

Imagine casting a net around a topic you don't understand. The "net" is made of
all the possible connections you can make to this topic; previous training,
analogy to other fields, half-notions of concepts.

### How it feels
The most important feelings I can associate with learning are boredom,
frustration, confusion, and flow.

Boredom tells you the work is too easy.

Frustration says you are missing something.

Confusion says you have over-reached. This is only a bad thing in large
amounts.

Flow says you've got it just right. It lies between boredom and confusion.

### Sequencing | When to Learn What

Find the highest-level summary of the topic you can. Then a slightly more
verbose description. Then yet another more verbosity write-up. Etc., etc.

When in doubt, jump in. Write down what confuses you. Keep going until the
confusion reaches a point that you can no longer pretend to know what's going
on. The list you've written is where you'll start tomorrow.

### Spacing | When to Learn
Learn until one of these two things happen: You feel confused, or you've
grasped a new topic but wouldn't be able to teach it well yourself. This is
where you'll pick up from.

As you revisit topics, mix in sources. If you began your exploration with an
online course, try: A blog post, a YouTube video, a textbook.

The day after learning, review your notes.  The next day, summarize them. Where
possible, use drawings and analogy.

## Basic tips
Only highlight/underline what you don't understand. It doesn't help you
remember, but it does help you find the gaps when you revisit the material.
Use some kind of notation for removing highlights as you do comprehend the
gaps.
