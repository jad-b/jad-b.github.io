## Love -- You're Doing It Wrong
Love can be seen as a desire to be desired. A desired to be valued.
Its pursuit in a consumerist society manifests itself in the pursuit of "seduction capital", that by owning the right
things we signal we have value, and thus you should value us.

But there is another way to think about love - to not play.

> In order to be valued, I need you to value me, which proves that I have no inherent value.

Instead, shift love towards tenderness. Shift it to an appreciation of your own and your loved one's weaknesses. Display
compassion to yourself, and then you will be able to display it to other human beings.

## [The Power of Vulnerability]

Two groups of people emerged from those who think they have a strong sense of love and belonging, and those who don't:
those who have it, believe they deserve to have it.

And the pattern that emerged from those who believe they deserve happiness, the "whole-hearted" group, was three things.
Courage, Compassion, and Connection.

Courage doesn't mean bravery here. Here's some etymology:

> To tell the story of who you are with your whole heart.

They had the courage to be imperfect.

They had the compassion to be kind to others. But to be kind to others, you have to be kind to yourself first.

They had connection as a result of authenticity. They were able to let go of
who they thought they should be, in order to be who they were. And this is
critical for connection.

There's one last thing. Vulnerability.

(See 9:44 to 11:15)

> They believed what made them vulnerable made them beautiful.

They talked about it being necessary; being able to say "I love you" first, to do something that could not work out.

The way to live was not to control and predict.

Is it possible that empathy is born from vulnerability?
Is it possible that "feeling alive" is born from vulnerability?
Is to avoid vulnerability to avoid living?
