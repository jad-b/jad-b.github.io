Probabilities are sensitive to the form of the question that was used to
generate the answer.

My neighbor has two children. Assuming that hte gneer of a child is like a coin
flip, it is most likely, a priori, that my neighbor has one boy and one girl,
with probability 1/2. The other possibilities--two boys or two girls--have
probabilities 1/4 and 1/4.

a. Suppose I ask him whether he has any boys, and he says yes. What is the
probability that one child is a girl?

b. Suppose instead that I happen to see one of his children run by, and it is a
boy. What is the probability that the other child is a girl?
