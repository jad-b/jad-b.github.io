## What are the fundamentals of D3.js?
* Selections
* Data joins
* SVG (so heavily used as to be a fundamental)

Everything else is a detail, or common knowledge amongst any graphing library,
such as setting axes on a chart, or a specialized library, such as drawing
force-directed network simulations.

### Selections
Selections provide _hierarchial groups_ of DOM elements. It is worth defining
_what_ a selection _is_: A JavaScript Object that associates arrays of DOM
elements with arrays of their parent DOM elements.

There are two functions for selecting in D3: [d3.select] and [d3.selectAll].
`d3.select` selects the first matching DOM element within the document.
Importantly, the parents are maintained

Assuming you have the following html:
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="display">
      <table>
        <tr><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td></td></tr>
      <!-- Closing tags left to your imagination -->
```
The following `d3.select` calls produce their accompanying results:
```javascript
d3.select("body")
// Parents=[<html>], Groups=[[<body>]]
d3.select("body").select("div#display")
// Parents=[<html>], Groups=[[<div#display>]]
d3.select("body").select("div#display").select("tr")
// Parents=[<html>], Groups=[[<tr>]]
```
You get the idea; the parent is unchanged by `.select`, and we do not extend the
groups with each selection.

In contrast, `d3.selectAll` selects all elements matching the CSS selector.
Chaining `.selectAll` results in multiple groups, with a corresponding chain of
parents. Re-using the above sample HTML:

```javascript
d3.selectAll("body")
// Parents=[<html>], Groups=[NodeList[<body>]]
d3.selectAll("body").selectAll("tr")
// Parents=[<body>], Groups=[NodeList[<tr>, <tr>,<tr>]]
// We have a group of three table rows
d3.selectAll("body").selectAll("tr").selectAll("td")
// Parents=[<tr>,<tr>,<tr>], Groups=[NodeList[<td>, <td>]x3]
// Each of the three prevous table row is now a parent to a group of two table
// cells
```
Note how the previous selection becomes the parent.
Calling `<selection>.selectAll` essentially performs _n_ searches off each of
the _n_ elements in `<selection>`. The results of these searches become the new
elements, grouped under their new parents. If no results are found, `null`
placeholder elements are returned for the group.

What if we mix them?
```javascript
d3.select("div#display").selectAll("tr")
// Parents=[<div#display>], Groups=[NodeList[<tr>, <tr>, <tr>]]
d3.selectAll("div").select("tr")
// Parents=[<html>], Groups=[[<tr>]]
// Parent of our first selection is html, which .select preserves
```

## Data binding
D3 _binds_ data by assigning a `__data__` property to each element in the group(s).
Thus, bound data lives outside a single selection's lifecycle, and persists
until the in-memory DOM representation is rebuilt, such as through a
page refresh. Since this is a simple object property assignment, you can do it
yourself: `document.body.__data__ = 42` will be picked up by D3 using
`d3.select("body").datum() === 42`. This also introduces the `.datum()` method
for assigning data to a single element.

However, the power of D3 shows when we get into _data joins_. By using
`<selection>.data(d)`, we perform a 1:1 assignment between data values and
groups within selection. Note that this leads to a requirement of D3 that all
data be bound in array form; the array itself can contain objects, strings,
numbers, more arrays, etc.
