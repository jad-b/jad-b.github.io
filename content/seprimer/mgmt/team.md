If you haven't been priviliged enough to experience it yet, being on a
close-knit team that's inspired by the same goal is one of the greatest
experiences a human can have, period. It is one of the pinnacles of social
experience, right up there with familial love. Some people even come to feel
like their co-worker's _like_ family (in the best sense of the word). How can we
create this for ourselves? Emphasis on *create*: Great teams have happened over
history as accident, but let's do better, shall we? Besides, we're engineers -
we solve problems. And creating great teams is a problem.

Trust is paramount. Trust in each other to do the right thing on a shared
purpose is the goal. Let's deconstruct this the best we can.
