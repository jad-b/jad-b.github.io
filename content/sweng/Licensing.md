From "[Scalable C]", by Pieter Hintjens:
> You are making public software, and want to benefit other public software

> this case you use the GPLv3 license.
>
> You are making public software with the goal of dumping your code into the
> market. You have no intention of growing a community. You have no intention of
> profit-taking. Your main goal is to hurt competitors. In this case you use the
> MIT/X11 or BSD license.
>
> You are making public software with the explicit goal of growing a community.
> You wish to see your code used as far and wide as possible. You wish to make
> profits. You want businesses to use your software and become clients. You want
> their engineers as contributors. You want to rope your competitors in as
> partners. In this case you use the MPLv2 license.
