<p>A jittery and slightly abusive love story.</p>

<p>I feel absurd writing this, but I&rsquo;m not sure coffe and I are meant to be
together. We always start out so good; that first cup in the morning gets my
mind going, and I mean <em>going</em>. Holy shit, the ideas that come into my
head&hellip;and the sheer <em>quantity</em>, I mean, just <em>dozens</em>. And that&rsquo;s any given
morning! Plus, the world seems so much more&hellip;<em>conquerable</em>: &ldquo;I can learn
front-end web development, calculus, machine learning, review my algorithms
textbook, and graphics programming simulatanesouly; I just need good time
management!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But coffee soon starts looking more like a siren than a muse. My carefully-laid
schedule, built to lay brick-by-brick of foundational knowledge and skill
towards my master plan, gets thrown out the window by sudden insights and
fervently-important tangents. Hell, these very words are due to coffee! I didn&rsquo;t
mean to write about my shitty relationship with coffee! I was gonna study
probability! God-<em>dammit</em>. Plus, I don&rsquo;t think my insides, how to say,
<em>accomodates</em> coffee very well. It&rsquo;s sneaky though; sometimes it takes a few
days. Of course, I usually lose my god-damned mind and &ldquo;1 cup in the morning,
and only after breakfast&rdquo; turns into &ldquo;2 cups, then some decaf, and oh shit I
didn&rsquo;t eat anything and now it&rsquo;s dinner&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going with this. It makes me feel great, and I&rsquo;ve had
some genuine breakthroughs that I attribute at least in part to coffee. I used
to think my body thought it was poison, but it could just as easily be my
inability to consume it responsibly; a cup after eating may be fine, but three
cups on an empty stomach not so much (writing that out begs a &ldquo;<em>sans
excrement</em>&rdquo;)</p>

<h2 id="pros:b19e3c9cdce88e87786a6b10c5d3deda">Pros</h2>

<p>Looking up <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/Caffeine/">Caffeine on examine.com</a>
eventually links to articles<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:b19e3c9cdce88e87786a6b10c5d3deda:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:b19e3c9cdce88e87786a6b10c5d3deda:1">1</a></sup> that show caffeine consumed <em>after</em> learning can
aid in memory consolidation. Interestingly, no benefit is shown when coffee is
drank <em>before</em> learning.</p>

<p>Let the good ideas <em>flow</em>. Valuable in my line of work and hobbies (which look a
lot like my line of work).</p>

<p>Lots of physical performance benefits are associated with caffeine: Training
volume, lactate production, power creation. You&rsquo;d be a <em>fool</em> not to use some!
But tea provides caffeine as well as coffee.</p>

<p>Some evidence that coffee (or caffeine; it&rsquo;s hard to pull them apart) helps with
the &ldquo;tip-of-the-tongue&rdquo; effect, i.e. recall by association. Very helpful; I just
remembered I wanted to buy &ldquo;Why Zebras Don&rsquo;t Get Ulcers&rdquo; for my girlfriend.</p>

<h2 id="cons:b19e3c9cdce88e87786a6b10c5d3deda">Cons</h2>

<p>Makes it <em>much</em> more likely my emotions get the better of my good sense, and
that may be the worst sin of all.</p>

<p>Seems to suppress my appetite. I am not a guy who needs his appetite suppressed,
so this is a major negative. However, this may only be when I drink coffe on an
empty stomach.</p>

<p>Possibly linked to some GI distress? See above note on coffee-before-or-after
food.</p>

<p>Browns your teeth. Seriously though, now you&rsquo;ve got something else to maintain.</p>

<p>Can make me more irritable, and short with people in general, and no likes a
cranky me.</p>

<p>Can lead to greater anxiety, which can reinforce other stressors, and
<em>stress</em> is a sure way to slowly ruin everything.</p>

<h2 id="verdict:b19e3c9cdce88e87786a6b10c5d3deda">Verdict</h2>

<p>I really like coffee. I feel like the answer lies in me figuring out its place
in my life, which sounds like in the morning, around 10, after I&rsquo;ve eaten and
done my morning studies.</p>
