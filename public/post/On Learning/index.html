<h1 id="why-optimize-learning:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">Why Optimize Learning?</h1>

<p>Why spend time learning <em>how</em> to learn, instead of just learning what you want?
What are the problems we overcome when learning? What are our goals?
What are the short and long-term benefits from optimizing how we learn?</p>

<h1 id="how-to-learn:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">How to Learn</h1>

<h2 id="figuring-out-what-to-learn:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">Figuring Out What to Learn</h2>

<ol>
<li>Guess at a topic</li>
<li>Overreach

<ol>
<li>Identify what you&rsquo;re confused by.

<ul>
<li>Write down every word, concept, and reference you don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find the prerequisite concepts for what confuses you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Repeat until you&rsquo;re on known ground.</li>
<li>Gather resources

<ol>
<li>Identify at least three resources. Each should take a different
approach: different wording, different examples, different formats
(slide deck, pdf, video, q&amp;a).</li>
<li>Scope the material

<ol>
<li>Table of contents from textbooks</li>
<li>Syllabus from a college course</li>
<li>Progression of a YouTube video series</li>
</ol></li>

<ol>
<li>(Optional) These may help in getting more out of a session.

<ol>
<li>Guess at Why it matters, and What problem it solves.  1. Look at some problems beforehand 1. Come up with questions</li>
<li>Warm-up by skimming the material, or reading a higher-level resource like
slides or an introductory text.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Begin

<ol>
<li>Note your start time.</li>
<li>(Optional) Set a timer. This can help focus you on the task at hand.
You may want to set enough time aside to perform a wrap-up of your notes.</li>
<li>Note questions and missing prerequisites as you go.

<ul>
<li>Jargon you need to define, statements you don&rsquo;t understand, completely mysterious
concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write, like with a pen, down difficult sections to work through. Writing
shows superior assistance in retention over typing<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468:1">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Consume material until confused (%50 comprehension), or out of time.

<ol>
<li>Note your end time, and calculate your adjusted velocity:
(pages read / time spent) * % comprehension = pg/min</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="review:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">Review</h3>

<ol>
<li>Attempt to recall material before referring to external resources.

<ol>
<li>Outlining key concepts can assist in reminding you what you learned.
It can also help for classifying the concept.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Every review, attempt to re-summarize what you wrote previously. Eventually
contain it down to a sentence or two.</li>
<li>Use your list of questions you built while learning to lookup answers.</li>
<li>Indicate relationships to other topics.</li>
<li>Use a system, like Anki SRS, for long-term memorization

<ul>
<li>Doing problems is insufficient as a review, but, for some reason, critical for
developing a complete understanding.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="doing-problems:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">Doing Problems</h3>

<ol>
<li>Discovery: Read the problems, w/o attempting to solve them.</li>
<li>Understanding: Read the problems, and solve them in a high-level way.</li>
<li>Remembering: Solve the problems which you deem to give you the most value.</li>
</ol>

<p>Apply the five methods from CCtI:
1. Examplify: Write out examples, look for the pattern
2. Pattern Matching: What is the problem similar to?
3. Simplify &amp; Generalize: Solve a simpler version of the problem, then abstract
   it to solve the larger case.
4. Base Case &amp; Build: Solve the problem for a single element. Think &ldquo;recursion&rdquo;.
5. Data Structure Brainstorm: Try to apply every data structure you can think of
   until something sticks.</p>

<h3 id="apply:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">Apply</h3>

<ol>
<li>Begin by conducting a Review.</li>
<li>Solve problems or build something

<ol>
<li>Use a timer to focus.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Cap at 30 minutes. If still unsolved, look up the solution, but reschedule as
it like any other problem.</li>
<li><strong>Q.</strong> Scheduling: How often should problems be worked? Re-worked?</li>

<h3 id="talking-to-myself:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">Talking to myself</h3>

<h4 id="on-homework-problems:7a16559f2e7bb44f60862eae17319468">On Homework Problems</h4>

<p>I remember spending the summer before my senior year doing hundreds of chemistry
problems, as assigned to me by my AP Chemistry teacher. For weeks straight, I
spent hours a day churning through them. Did I come to understand stoichoimetry?
Uh huh. And it&rsquo;s with experiences like this, and the continuing assignment of
homework in school, that makes me think doing homework <em>does</em> increase
understanding. But where do the diminishing returns lie?</p>

<p>Ever since hearing Ben Vigoda mention off-hand during an OSCON 2015 presentation
on probabilistic programming that research has shown humans can learn to
recognize a new object after about 3-5 exposures, I&rsquo;ve wondered if there&rsquo;s a bit
of magic to that range. Coupling that with phenomenon like Spaced Repetition for
studying, can we arrive at a approximately-optimal solution for studying?</p>

<p>I think we can. Say you&rsquo;re reading a textbook split into chapters, with sections
within those chapters. I propose a schedule like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day one) Read the first section of the first chapter.</li>
<li>Day two) Read the second section, and do 2-3 problems from the first section.</li>
<li>Day three) Read the third section, do 2-3 problems from the second section,
and 1 problem from the first section.</li>
<li>Day four) Read fourth section; 2 problems from third, 1 problem from second</li>
<li>Day five) Chapter&rsquo;s finished; do 2 end-of-chapter problems, 2 fourth section
problems, 1 third section problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view the schedule as a table, with rows of topics, columns of dates, and
cells holding the action you took to learn. The action could be solving a
problem, reading a section, or reviewing your notes; intuitively, it makes sense
to read the material, work on some problems, and save review for the long game.</p>

<p>The problem&rsquo;s been defined; how can we automate? At its simplest, we have an
ever-growing queue of work that needs to be scheduled at some point in the
future. There&rsquo;s also a hierarchy amongst topics that we&rsquo;ll want to leverage; obviously
the sections of a chapter are grouped together for a reason. Come a year from
now, we want our review to be focused on the <em>chapter</em>, not on problem 4.2-5.
Indeed, the problems are simply tools for the much more valuable concepts they
engage us with.</p>

<p>SuperMemo has a distinction between <em>topics</em> and <em>items</em> which I think applies
here. To a point, we can treat the structure recursively; scholarly fields keep
their information in textbooks, which have chapters, which have sections. At the
lowest point, we must distinguish between the tools we use to learn at the
topics we wish to learn.</p>
