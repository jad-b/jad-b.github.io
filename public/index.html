      I&rsquo;ve been interested in human improvement for over a decade now, but I&rsquo;d have to say it started when I got into weight lifting. It&rsquo;s such a perfect black-box: input exercise, output personal improvement. We have not come so far as to split off from our physical selves. I&rsquo;ve progressed and regressed more than I can keep track of, but I&rsquo;ve (mostly) enjoyed the process. How I learned, however, is not how I would recommend to another.

      A jittery and slightly abusive love story. I feel absurd writing this, but I&rsquo;m not sure coffe and I are meant to be together. We always start out so good; that first cup in the morning gets my mind going, and I mean going. Holy shit, the ideas that come into my head&hellip;and the sheer quantity, I mean, just dozens. And that&rsquo;s any given morning! Plus, the world seems so much more&hellip;conquerable: &ldquo;I can learn front-end web development, calculus, machine learning, review my algorithms textbook, and graphics programming simulatanesouly; I just need good time management!&rdquo; But coffee soon starts looking more like a siren than a muse.

      Multilevel models are statistical models of parameters that vary at more than one level. - source: [Multilevel model:wikipedia]. This implies that the same parameters can take different values amongst sibling models of different parents. To illustrate, let&rsquo;s work through the example given in wikipedia: A basic linear regression model for predicting income may take age, class, gender, and race as parameters: $f(age,class,gender,race) = income$. However, this is likely to predict the same income for a 45-year old black man in Seattle, WA as it would for one in Mobile, AL.

      Use TLS from the beginning. There aren&rsquo;t many reasons you shouldn&rsquo;t. Snakeoil gets you in the practice of managing the keys, but a self-signed or corporate wildcard cert that&rsquo;s scoped to your development domain are even better. I&rsquo;m finally seeing a plethora of key management tools1 begin to propagate, so no excuses. Write functional tests to run against any envinromnet. This means they need to accept configuration options, and should only affect test data they&rsquo;re responsible for creating and deleting.

      <blockquote>
<p>Gradient descent keeps ascending my cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Funny story</em>, the issue wasn&rsquo;t with the gradient descent implementation at all, but rather
the cost function(least squares). I was calculating my error by subtracting my
predicted values from the actual values(y), <code>$error = predicted - y$</code>, instead of the other
way around, <code>$ error = y - predicted$</code>.</p>

      Learning is being in a race against yourself. These things help. The Rapid Acquisistion of Highly-Technical Information Learning very technical information is unique from the general problem of learning in a few ways. First of all, the end-result is entirely mental. Either you understand the concepts well enough to accomplish your task, or you do not. This is in contrast to learning a song on the piano, where a subconscious system is learning instead, like training motor patterns for rote memorization.
