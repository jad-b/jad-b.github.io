<h5 id="takeaways:80d78c5218f8687004095bfb4a3d3a5e">Takeaways</h5>

<ul>
<li>Learning is a Bandit problem: Do you explore or exploit?</li>
<li>Consider learning broadly &amp; iteratively, as opposed to deeply and sequentially</li>
<li>There needs to be a heuristic for determining when to go &ldquo;down&rdquo;, and switch to more
fundamental material.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I will study Introduction to Algorithms, 5.3. This calls for a review of
5.2, as well as whatever Anki prompts me for regarding 5.1.</p>

<p>But, back to today&rsquo;s studies: If I reflect, I feel I recall the lessons from 5.1
(two days ago) are still fresh, and I could easily re-write them if necessary.
5.2 would return with a modicum of effort, as one would expect being only a day
old. I prepare to study, I study, I create resources for review, I review, I do
problems. Still, when the time comes to do the problems, I often find them quite
puzzling. I perhaps under-estimated CLRS, since I&rsquo;d already used it in my
undergraduate algorithm&rsquo;s course. And, perhaps, time has stolen what easy
familiarity I had with statistics and calculus in the first place - or maybe
this is as good as I&rsquo;ve ever been. Oh well; I know now what I know, there is no
other choice for a starting place.</p>

<p>Where I&rsquo;m going with this is: do I need to take a step back, re-learn the basics
before attempting to progress? Given infinite time, I might re-take Algebra or
even Geometry to refresh all that has decayed with disuse. But infinite time
isn&rsquo;t an option, and I&rsquo;m presented with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Multi-Armed Bandit problem</a>: Do I
explore more avenues of learning, or do I exploit (study) what I&rsquo;ve landed upon?
I had skipped reviewing the appendices A &amp; C on Summations and Counting &amp;
Probability; never too late to go back.</p>

<p>Last night I spent some time finding recommended textbooks for Calculus and
Statistics from Quora. It was surprisingly fruitful; I&rsquo;m quite excited for
several of the books I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0914098918/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3S5ZAOCXZJ47H&amp;coliid=IMTWWBJDML1LI">Calculus by Michael
Spivak</a>
came highly recommended, at least twice.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/188652923X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3S5ZAOCXZJ47H&amp;coliid=I21BQ7JLWUC58U">Introduction to Probability, by Bertsekas &amp;
Tsitsiklis</a>
also showed up several times. It is the introductory probability book for MIT
&amp; Stanford. The poster made an interesting distinction between probability and
statistics that I hadn&rsquo;t before considered.</li>
<li><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1439840954/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=3S5ZAOCXZJ47H&amp;coliid=IHYGHDNH1KDQF">Bayesian Data Analysis, by
Gelman</a>.
Recommended for applying Bayesian methods, but several reviews said it was
light on <em>why</em> and <em>when</em> you would do so. I expect to pair-read this with
another book on the topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>The findings mostly came from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-online-courses-and-books-available-for-learning-probability-and-statistics/answer/Justin-Rising?srid=9cIW">this
post</a>. I must confess to myself, I find the theory as interesting as the application.</p>

<p>How will I know to take a step back, and move to a different textbook? Maybe
expecting to complete a subject in one pass is silly; perhaps I should be
<em>expecting</em> to revisit material, and bounce up-and-down its chain of
prerequisites as I need.</p>

<p>I am always haunted by the feeling there is a better way.</p>
