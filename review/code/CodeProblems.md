Apply the five methods from CCtI:
1. Examplify: Write out examples, look for the pattern
2. Pattern Matching: What is the problem similar to?
3. Simplify & Generalize: Solve a simpler version of the problem, then abstract
   it to solve the larger case.
4. Base Case & Build: Solve the problem for a single element. Think "recursion".
5. Data Structure Brainstorm: Try to apply every data structure you can think of
   until something sticks.
