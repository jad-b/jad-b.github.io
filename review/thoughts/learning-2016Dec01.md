##### Takeaways
* Learning is a Bandit problem: Do you explore or exploit?
* Consider learning broadly & iteratively, as opposed to deeply and sequentially
* There needs to be a heuristic for determining when to go "down", and switch to more
  fundamental material.

Today I will study Introduction to Algorithms, 5.3. This calls for a review of
5.2, as well as whatever Anki prompts me for regarding 5.1.

But, back to today's studies: If I reflect, I feel I recall the lessons from 5.1
(two days ago) are still fresh, and I could easily re-write them if necessary.
5.2 would return with a modicum of effort, as one would expect being only a day
old. I prepare to study, I study, I create resources for review, I review, I do
problems. Still, when the time comes to do the problems, I often find them quite
puzzling. I perhaps under-estimated CLRS, since I'd already used it in my
undergraduate algorithm's course. And, perhaps, time has stolen what easy
familiarity I had with statistics and calculus in the first place - or maybe
this is as good as I've ever been. Oh well; I know now what I know, there is no
other choice for a starting place.

Where I'm going with this is: do I need to take a step back, re-learn the basics
before attempting to progress? Given infinite time, I might re-take Algebra or
even Geometry to refresh all that has decayed with disuse. But infinite time
isn't an option, and I'm presented with a [Multi-Armed Bandit problem]: Do I
explore more avenues of learning, or do I exploit (study) what I've landed upon?
I had skipped reviewing the appendices A & C on Summations and Counting &
Probability; never too late to go back.

Last night I spent some time finding recommended textbooks for Calculus and
Statistics from Quora. It was surprisingly fruitful; I'm quite excited for
several of the books I found:

* [Calculus by Michael
  Spivak](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0914098918/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3S5ZAOCXZJ47H&coliid=IMTWWBJDML1LI)
  came highly recommended, at least twice.
* [Introduction to Probability, by Bertsekas &
  Tsitsiklis](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/188652923X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3S5ZAOCXZJ47H&coliid=I21BQ7JLWUC58U)
  also showed up several times. It is the introductory probability book for MIT
  & Stanford. The poster made an interesting distinction between probability and
  statistics that I hadn't before considered.
* [Bayesian Data Analysis, by
  Gelman](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1439840954/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3S5ZAOCXZJ47H&coliid=IHYGHDNH1KDQF).
  Recommended for applying Bayesian methods, but several reviews said it was
  light on _why_ and _when_ you would do so. I expect to pair-read this with
  another book on the topic.

The findings mostly came from [this
post](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-online-courses-and-books-available-for-learning-probability-and-statistics/answer/Justin-Rising?srid=9cIW).
I must confess to myself, I find the theory as interesting as the application.

How will I know to take a step back, and move to a different textbook? Maybe
expecting to complete a subject in one pass is silly; perhaps I should be
_expecting_ to revisit material, and bounce up-and-down its chain of
prerequisites as I need.

I am always haunted by the feeling there is a better way.
