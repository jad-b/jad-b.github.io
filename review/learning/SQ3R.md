The SQ3R system is an acronym for the steps Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and
Review. As we'll see, it shares the same basic structure as How to Read a Book.

Surveying is your inspectional reading; you are getting the subject matter to
divulge its structure, and its boundaries. Tackling a chapter on
electromagnetism, you would see the chapter and sections titles form an outline
of key concepts, essential terms are highlighted, and important experiments are
shown in diagrams. Importantly, the limits of the subject matter begin to come
into focus.

> Survey the material to learn its structure and limits.

At the limits of our understanding, we can ask Questions. Student-led question
generation comes up often as a valuable learning technique (that Asia learning
group article, HtRaB in its entirety). Intuitively, it makes sense; we ask
questions to gain information. Perhaps one day we'll be able to visualize
neuron growth be potentiated by the formulation of a question, giving us a more
concrete explanation of the value of having a question. I believe having the
reader generate the question is more useful than being given them is due to
every learner being in a different learning state, with different levels of
fact, understanding, and associated learning to bring to the table. Facts you
take for granted may be beyond me, and thus our questions look different.

Thought experiment: Let's say you and I begin a class on astrophysics together.
We'll assume that our initial questions _will_ differ significantly from each
other's early on in the class, but of course be fundamentally related by the
nature of the generating material being the same (astrophysics). We both love
the subject, and go on to get PhDs in the field. While TA'ing a class on
astrophysics for undergrad studnets in the same position we were at the start of
this paragraph, we try to generate questions to help the students learn. How
different will these questions look now? Will our understanding have
_converged_, and thus our representative questions of it as well? Or does our
initial state leave a persistent impression in our understanding?

Now, we __Read__. Surely we know how to (do this by now)[#how-to-read-a-book].
The emphasis within SQ3R while reading is to seek answers to the questions
from the previous step, your "early research". The SQ3R descriptions I've found
only seem to focus on answering your previous questions, but obviously you go as
deep as you can afford to. This, by the way, equates to the Analytical Reading
of HtRaB.

> Read for understanding, answering your questions as you can.

The step of __Recite__ is a pleasantly unexpected nod of recognition towards the
importance of creating the knowledge in your words. This is something that HtRaB
touches on, but gets lost in its depth and breadth of instruction. Essentially,
you need to word your own answers to the questions you've created. The idea of
saying this out loud comes up repeatedly, and if you've never had a good
conversation with yourself, you _are_ missing out. I expect you'd see similar
performance improvement from writing/re-(re-...)writing your answer until
satisfied. This is the natural place for the use of the Feynman Technique.
Berkely's PQ4R makes a superficial division of the other SQ3R's Recite step into
Recite/Review, but it comes out to the same: Answer the question(s).

> Answer in your own words. Aim to improve on the canonical answer.

We done? Almost, almost. We must __remember__ if anything is to come of our
efforts.  I see advice such as: review your notes cumulatively. Review often,
in small batches. Re-perform the entire process, adding in what you missed the
first time around. The Berkeley article states a student should be spending 2-3
times studying as they do in class, a significant amount of time (given the intent of
this research, I hope to improve drastically on that). No specific advice is
given regarding how _often_, or what that format should look like. But you get
the idea:

> You can't just read it once.

### Final Thoughts
SQ3R is a fine framework for a learning system. I believe it would give a
generic efficiency to the approach of a new topic, especially compared to no
system at all.  It is a bit light on implementation, so it beckons the reader's
experimentation.

It's remarkable how we're uncovering the same pattern: Discover the subject.
Seek understanding. Review to remember. It leads me to believe I'm either a)
approaching the underlying form of how we learn, or b) everyone's reading the
same books I am.  And the latter is a very real concern, so finding some more
unorthodox sources would be beneficial. Maybe this is a Western thing, so
books resources from Eastern or African cultures.
