## Finding Sources
1. Guess at your desired topic
1. Overreach by diving right into it.
    1. Identify what you're confused by.
        * Write down every word, concept, and reference you don't understand.
1. Return to Repeat until you're on known ground.
1. Gather resources
    1. Identify at least three resources. Each should take a different
       approach: different wording, different examples, different formats
       (slide deck, pdf, video, q&a).
    1. Scope the material
        1. Table of contents from textbooks
        1. Syllabus from a college course
        1. Progression of a YouTube video series
